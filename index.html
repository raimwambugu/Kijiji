            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h4>Origin Story</h4>
            <p>The idea came from Raim Wambugu when he noticed that content creators on social apps are showing hidden gems that they know of. Then a question crossed his mind ,”Why not have a hidden gem locator that shows you where to easily find a hidden gem?”. So basically he's creating an app that easily locates hidden gems where one can easily find them without getting lost. It will benefit both the seller and the buyer as it will attract customers to the hidden gem. It will help the sellers to portray what they offer. It will also be helpful to tourists and locals who are looking for a hidden gem. The word ‘Kijiji’ originates from Swahili which means ‘village’ as it portrays unity and togetherness bringing people closer together just as in a village </p>
            <h4>Function</h4>
            <p>Kijiji is a travel discovery app that helps users find and share hidden gem locations — unique, lesser-known places that offer authentic and memorable experiences. Users can explore curated spots, contribute their own discoveries, and connect with a community passionate about off-the-beaten-path travel.</p>
